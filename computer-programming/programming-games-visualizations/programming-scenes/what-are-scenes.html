 <p>Many games and visualizations have what we call &quot;scenes&quot;, and they need some way of managing those &quot;scenes.&quot; What do I mean by scenes?</p>

<p>Take for example, <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/cs/balloon-popper-2/5419249456119808">Balloon Popper 2</a>. It has four scenes:</p>

<table>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>A start scene</strong></td>
			<td><img src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/6564d655699a86ffb4bb2deb4ce61a48a3110795.png" style="width:200px" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>A how-to-play scene &nbsp;</strong></td>
			<td><img src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/fa0886d6744d9d4b53ebf2bc1e315c3cfdeb56d3.png" style="width:200px" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>A playing scene &nbsp;</strong></td>
			<td><img alt="" src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/7fd780584ceb8ec56d82f31767757ca82480330c.png" style="width:200px" /></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><strong>A game over scene &nbsp;</strong></td>
			<td><img alt="" src="https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/f47696a430369f8a509f6c60133f819887f3363b.png" style="width:200px" /></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

<p>Most games have those scenes, in fact. Each scene is a distinct state of the program that displays different information, and there is some way for the user to get from one scene to the next. Maybe it&#39;s a simple mouse click or key press, or maybe it&#39;s selecting a scene from a menu.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve realized that you need something like scenes for your program, you&#39;ll have to decide how to program them. Like many things in programming, there are many ways to do that, but we&#39;ll hopefully give you a few ideas.</p>
