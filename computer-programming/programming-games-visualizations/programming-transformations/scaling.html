 <p>The final coordinate system transformation is scaling, which changes the size of the grid. Take a look at this program, which draws a square, then scales the grid to twice its normal size, and draws it again.</p>

<p>First, you can see that the square appears to have moved. It hasn&rsquo;t, of course. Its upper left corner is still at (20, 20) on the scaled-up grid, but that point is now twice as far away from the origin as it was in the original coordinate system.</p>

<p>If you wanted the large square to start at the same corner as the small square, you could translate first, and then scale:</p>

<p>You might also notice from both of those programs that the lines are thicker on the large squares. That&rsquo;s no optical illusion&mdash;the lines really are twice as thick, because the coordinate system has been scaled to double its size. You could explicitly change the <code>strokeWeight()</code> to account for that, or avoid using <code>scale()</code> all together.</p>

<p>The <code>scale()</code> command optionally accepts two parameters instead of just one, so you can scale the x and y dimensions separately. Try using <code>scale(3.0, 0.5)</code> in the above program to make the x dimension three times its normal size and the y dimension only half its normal size.</p>
