<p>Before we jump into building our first slider, let's take a look at the one below and think about what we would need to do to create something similar in Processing.js.</p>

<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10">

<p>Let's break it down into several simpler steps.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a long thin rectangle for the track of the slider.</li>
	<li>Draw the circle handle on top of the track</li>
	<li>Have the handle follow the mouse along the track when it is clicked and dragged.</li>
</ol>
