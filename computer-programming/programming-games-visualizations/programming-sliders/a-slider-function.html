	Before we jump into building our first slider, let's take a look at the one below 
	and think about what we would need to do to create something similar in ProcessingJS.
</p>

<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10">

<p>
	For our most basic slider, we can start with these simple steps.
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a long, thin rectangle for the track of the slider.</li>
	<li>Draw the circle handle on top of the track</li>
	<li>Make the handle move along the track when a user clicks and drags it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	For steps #1 and #2, we can simply write:
</p>

<pre><code>
	// draw the track
	fill(180);
	strokeWeight(0.5);
	rect(150, 200, 100, 5, 10);

	// draw circular handle
	fill(235);
	ellipse(150, 203, 15, 15);
</code></pre>

<p>
That was easy!  All we needed to do was draw a rectangle and circle. However, did you notice the mysterious
fifth value we passed into <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code>? 
</p>

<pre><code>
	rect(150, 200, 100, 5, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>
If you take a look at the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/rectx-y-w-h/839496660" target="_blank">documentation</a> 
for <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code>, you will see it has an optional (and somewhat hidden) parameter called 
<code>radius</code> which sets the radius of the corners of the rectangle when rounding them. It does not
normally appear in the list of parameters in <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code> because it is not a requirement to run the function.
</p>

<p>
With steps #1 and #2 out of the way, we are ready to get into the fun stuff.  But wait!  Right now this
code is very difficult to understand with all those confusing "hardcoded" numbers. Also, if we want to
change anything about the slider like its position or the its width, we will have to change values
in several places and have trouble knowing which value mean what.  For now, let's create variables for
the slider position, width, height, and handle diameter: <code>sliderX</code>, <code>sliderY</code>, 
<code>sliderWidth</code>, <code>sliderHeight</code>, and <code>handleDiam</code>.
</p>

<pre><code>
	var sliderX = 150;
	var sliderY = 200;
	var sliderWidth = 100;
	var sliderHeight = 5;
	var handleDiam = 15;

	// draw the track
	fill(180);
	strokeWeight(0.5);
	rect(sliderX, sliderY, sliderWidth, sliderHeight, 10);

	// draw circular handle
	fill(235);
	ellipse(sliderX, sliderY+sliderHeight/2, handleDiam, handleDiam);
</code></pre>
