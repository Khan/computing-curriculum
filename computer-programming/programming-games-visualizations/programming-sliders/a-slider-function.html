Before we jump into building our first slider, let's take a look at this HTML slider 
and think about what we would need to do to create something similar in ProcessingJS.
</p>

<input type="range" min="0" max="50" value="10">

<p>
	We can start with these simple steps:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Draw a long, thin rectangle for the track of the slider.</li>
	<li>Draw the circle handle on top of the track</li>
	<li>Make the handle move along the track when a user clicks and drags it.</li>
</ol>

<p>
	For steps #1 and #2, we can simply write:
</p>

<pre><code>
	// draw the track
	fill(180);
	strokeWeight(0.5);
	rect(150, 200, 100, 6, 10);

	// draw circular handle
	fill(235);
	ellipse(150, 203, 15, 15);
</code></pre>

<p>
That was easy!  All we needed to do was draw a rectangle and circle. However, did you notice the mysterious
fifth value we passed into <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code>? 
</p>

<pre><code>
	rect(150, 200, 100, 5, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>
If you take a look at the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/rectx-y-w-h/839496660" 
target="_blank">documentation</a> for <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code>, 
you will see it has an optional (and somewhat hidden) parameter called <code>radius</code> 
which sets the radius of the corners of the rectangle when rounding them. 
It does not appear in the list of parameters in <code>rect(x, y, w, h)</code> because it is not a requirement 
to run the function.
</p>

<p>
With steps #1 and #2 out of the way, we are ready to get into the fun stuff.  But wait!  
Right now this code is very difficult to understand with all those confusing "hardcoded" numbers. 
By looking at that code, it is really hard to determine which number relates to the slider's 
position or width.  Also, if we want to change anything about the slider like its position or its width, 
we will have to change values in several places and will have difficulties determining which 
number relates to which part of the slider. 
This can easily be changed by replacing the numbers with variables for the slider position, width, height, 
and handle diameter: <code>sliderX</code>, <code>sliderY</code>, <code>sliderWidth</code>, 
<code>sliderHeight</code>, and <code>handleDiam</code>.
