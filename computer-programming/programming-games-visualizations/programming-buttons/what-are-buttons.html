 <p>Buttons. Buttons, buttons, buttons!&nbsp;Besides being the shape of my nose, a&nbsp;button is an area&nbsp;that you click to make something happen. Look around this webpage, how many button-y things&nbsp;do you see? Look around wherever you&#39;re sitting, how many button-y things surround you?</p>

<p>There are buttons&nbsp;everywhere, and you&#39;ll often want some sort of button in the programs that you make here. Check out these example programs to see how they use buttons:</p>

<p>There are some programming environments that provide buttons and other user interface elements out of the box, like HTML provides&nbsp;for webpages, but ProcessingJS is not one of those. Instead, ProcessingJS gives us building blocks:</p>

<ul>
	<li>commands to draw shapes and text</li>
	<li>ways to listen to events</li>
	<li>ways to detect the mouse location of them.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can put those building blocks together to make buttons, and in doing so, we&#39;ll learn more about programming. We&#39;ll start with the simplest button possible, then make our code more re-usable with functions, and finally organize it even more with object-oriented principles.</p>

<p>Onward, to the button-mobile!</p>
