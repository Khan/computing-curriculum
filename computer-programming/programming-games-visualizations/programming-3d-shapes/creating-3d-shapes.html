 <p>A simple shape to start working with is a cube. Although a tetrahedron has fewer sides, its sides aren&#39;t orthogonal, which makes things trickier. Let&#39;s start by creating a&nbsp;200&times;200&times;200&nbsp;pixel cube, centred at the origin (0, 0, 0).</p>

<p>We will start not with actually drawing anything, but with coming up with arrays of numbers that describe our shapes in 3D shape - specifically, arrays that describe our <strong>nodes</strong> and our <strong>edges</strong>.</p>

<h3>Nodes</h3>

<p>We start by defining an array of nodes, where each node is an array of three digits, the x, y and z coordinates of that node:</p>

<pre>
<code>var node0 = [-100, -100, -100];
var node1 = [-100, -100, 100];
var node2 = [-100, 100, -100];
var node3 = [-100, 100, 100];
var node4 = [ 100, -100, -100];
var node5 = [ 100, -100, 100];
var node6 = [ 100, 100, -100];
var node7 = [ 100, 100, 100];
var nodes = [node0, node1, node2, node3, node4, node5, node6, node7];</code></pre>

<p>As you may have noticed, the nodes are all 8 ways of arranging three lots of positive or negative 100.</p>

<p>You can see the nodes of a 2x2x2 cube centered at the origin in the visualization&nbsp;below. Rotate using the mouse:</p>

<h3>Edges</h3>

<p>Next we define an array of edges, where each edge is an array of two numbers. For example,&nbsp;<code>edge0</code> defines an edges between <code>node0</code> and <code>node1</code>. We start counting at 0 because arrays are indexed starting at zero (To get the value of the first node we type <code>nodes[0]</code>).</p>

<pre>
<code>var edge0 = [0, 1];
var edge1 = [1, 3];
var edge2 = [3, 2];
var edge3 = [2, 0];
var edge4 = [4, 5];
var edge5 = [5, 7];
var edge6 = [7, 6];
var edge7 = [6, 4];
var edge8 = [0, 4];
var edge9 = [1, 5];
var edge10 = [2, 6];
var edge11 = [3, 7];
var edges = [edge0, edge1, edge2, edge3, edge4, edge5, edge6, edge7, edge8, edge9, edge10, edge11];</code></pre>

<p>The tricky part is making sure you join the right edges together. Here&#39;s a visualization of the edges we&#39;re connecting for a cube:</p>
